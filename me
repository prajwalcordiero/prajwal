# SoftWizz
As a team, we identified a major challenge in the production industry
where decision-makers rely on outdated reports.
Many business owners and higher management personnel lack the
technical expertise to write SQL queries for real-time data access.
Even when data is retrieved, interpreting raw datasets without proper
visualization makes it difficult to derive actionable insights.
This results in delayed responses, missed opportunities, and inefficient
operations.
We wanted to bridge the gap between data accessibility and decision-
making using AI.
